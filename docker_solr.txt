To run a single Solr server:
$ docker run --name my_solr -d -p 8983:8983 -t solr
Then with a web browser go to http://localhost:8983/ to see the Admin Console (adjust the hostname for your docker host).
To use Solr, you need to create a "core", an index for your data. For example:
$ docker exec -it --user=solr my_solr bin/solr create_core -c gettingstarted
In the web UI if you click on "Core Admin" you should now see the "gettingstarted" core.
If you want to load some of the example data that is included in the container:
$ docker exec -it --user=solr my_solr bin/post -c gettingstarted example/exampledocs/manufacturers.xml
